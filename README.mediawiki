== Calculator app ==

=== Naming ===
We need a (good) name for the program! If you have any ideas, open an issue.

=== Features ===
As of 9/26/11, the application supports the following features:
# Math features
## Addition
## Subtraction
## Multiplication
## Division
## Exponents
### Shortcuts for squares
### Shortcuts for cubes
## Roots
### Shortcuts for square roots
### Shortcuts for cube roots
## Logarithms
### Shortcuts for common logarithms
## Factorials
# General features
## Says hi
## Intelligent
## At any prompt, type quit or panic to exit, no questions asked.
### Won't let you divide by 0
### Won't let you root a number that would return a value with ''i'' (since this does Bad Things to the program)
### Won't let you factorial a number too high (since that would give an incorrect answer)
### Recognizes squares, cubes, square roots, cube roots, and common logarithms even if you use the regular exponent, root, multiplication, or logarithm functions
## Once done, calculator will ask if you want to use again

A general list follows, but this may not be up-to-date or current (it will probably be missing items instead of having fixed ones)
# Whoa, there's no issues right now.

=== Development ===
You're welcome to develop this program at https://github.com/strugee/HelloWorld3 - just hit fork.

==== Todo ====
# Implement e (Euler's number = ~2.17)
## Make everything recognize e (especially log, for ln = natural log = log base e)
# Implement trig functions
