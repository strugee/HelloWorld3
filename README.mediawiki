# Math features

## Multiplication
## Division

### Shortcuts for squares
### Shortcuts for cubes

### Shortcuts for square roots

# General features
## Says hi
## Intelligent
### Won't let you divide by 0
### Won't let you root a number that would return a value with ''i'' (since this does Bad Things to the program)
### Won't let you factorial a number too high (since that would give an incorrect answer)
### Recognizes squares, cubes, square roots and cube roots even if you use the exponent, root, or multiplication functions
## Once done, calculator will ask if you want to use again

=== Development ===
You're welcome to develop this program at https://github.com/strugee/HelloWorld3 - just hit fork.

==== Todo ====
Todos are listed at the top of HelloWorld.cpp in a comment block. They'll be put here soon.
