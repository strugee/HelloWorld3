== Calculator app (beta) ==

=== Naming ===
We need a (good) name for the program! If you have any ideas, open an issue.

=== Features ===
As of 9/26/11, the application supports the following features:
# Math features
## Addition
## Subtraction
## Multiplication
## Division
## Exponents
### Shortcuts for squares
### Shortcuts for cubes
## Roots
### Shortcuts for square roots
### Shortcuts for cube roots
## Logarithms
### Shortcuts for common logarithms
## Factorials
# General features
## Says hi
## Tells you what language it's written in
## Intelligent
## Marked as stable on 10/26/11 (woo!)
## At any prompt, type quit or panic to exit, no questions asked.
### Won't let you divide by 0
### Won't let you root a number that would return a value with ''i'' (since this does Bad Things to the program)
### Won't let you factorial a number too high (since that would give an incorrect answer due to technical reasons)
### Recognizes squares, cubes, square roots, cube roots, and common logarithms even if you use the regular exponent, root, multiplication, or logarithm functions
## Once done, calculator will ask if you want to use again

=== Known Issues ===

A general list follows, but this may not be up-to-date or current (it will probably be missing items instead of having fixed ones)
# Whoa, no issues at this time

=== Development ===
You're welcome to develop this program at https://github.com/strugee/HelloWorld3 - just hit fork.

==== Todo ====
# Implement e (Euler's number = ~2.17)
## Make everything recognize e (especially log, for ln = natural log = log base e)
# Implement trig functions
# Make requests for numbers contextual
# Make it so the user can go back to previous prompt

==== Fail Values ====
This is a chart for the FailReason variable, which the calculate() method will set when it fails, along with returning 1. Trust me, you'll need it.
{| border="1"
|0.||Divided by 0
|-
|1.||Answer would have been complex (with ''i'', as opposed to real, without ''i'')
|-
|2.||Factorial is too big
